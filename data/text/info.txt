**Hello! I am Bez Leda, a simple companion bot made by TheCyberFlash for TheCyberFlash.**

I am here to assist you and provide useful information about TheCyberFlash's YouTube channel. Please note that I am not a public bot for other servers. This bot is a personal side project for TheCyberFlash to practice and explore new technologies.

- `!latest (video)`: Retrieves the link to the latest YouTube video on TheCyberFlash's channel.
- `!subs`: Displays the total number of subscribers TheCyberFlash has on YouTube.
- `!subgoal`: Shows the progress towards the subscriber goal.
- `!memgoal`: Shows the progress towards the member goal.
- `!schedule`: Provides the streaming schedule for TheCyberFlash's YouTube channel.
- `!rps (rock/paper/scissors)`: Play Rock Paper Scissors with the bot.

- `!reset`: Resets the scores of all players in the Rock Paper Scissors game. (Admin only)
- `!reset @username:` Resets the scores of the specified user in the Rock Paper Scissors game. (Admin only)

Please keep in mind that some commands are restricted to administrators only for security reasons. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
